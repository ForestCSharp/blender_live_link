TODO
	- live-updates don't work after loading test_file (or any file?)
	- Clean up dynamic gameplay component system. Make sure all the per-type stuff stays together
		- maybe an init class method?

Next:
	- Lights:
		- Proper falloff that matches blender eevee rendering

Tasks:
	- send skeletal mesh data (and animations)
	- don't build up vertex format until you get to c++, the big vtx/idx loops in python are likely very slow and we should just memcpy those if possible

Bugs:
	- last 'mesh' object can't be deleted for some reason
	- delete-all doesn't work either, likely related to above
	- object deletion or undo/redo sends full update?
