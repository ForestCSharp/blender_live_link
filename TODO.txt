TODO

Next:
	- SpotLights:
		- proper formula for spot lights in GLSL

	- Play/Reset in game: (resets to state loaded from Blender...)

Tasks:
	- send light data
		- actually use lights to light scene
		- draw light icon 
		- add to some light_data buffer we'll pass to mesh drawing

	- send skeletal mesh data (and animations)
	- option to enable physics
	- don't build up vertex format until you get to c++, the big vtx/idx loops in python are likely very slow and we should just memcpy those if possible

Bugs:
	- last 'mesh' object can't be deleted for some reason
	- delete-all doesn't work either, likely related to above
	- object deletion or undo/redo sends full update?
