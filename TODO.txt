TODO

	- need to place a lot of GI probes
		- evaluate cubemap, octahedral map, SH, SG

	- Don't run shaders on disabled render passes...
	- Fix IsGrounded for Character Jumping

Tasks:
	- GI/Reflection Captures
	- Skinned Animations
	- Shadows
		- Cascaded Shadow Map on Sunlight
		- Screen Space Shadows
	- Temporal Anti Aliasing
	- Sokol Compute Shaders
		- [TODO] first use-case

Improvements:
	- On Updates, don't re-create all object functionality, determine what actually changed and just update that
		- ex: If you didn't change geometry, don't recreate mesh
		- ex: If you didn't change physics, don't recreate physics state
	- Consider option to wait until a move operation is done to send a live link update
	- Make sure rigid body and character don't exist on same object
	- replace optional ids for character and camera control with map of tagged IDs

Bugs:
	- deleting a child by deleting its parent in blender doesn't delete the child in game
	- deleting object representing our player character or camera control is currently invalid
		- need to clean up the id's representing those entities
