	- Skinned Animations
	- Texturing and PBR
		- subset of blender nodes converted to material shaders...
	- Reflection Captures
	- Shadows
		- Cascaded Shadow Map on Sunlight
		- Screen Space Shadows
	- Temporal Anti Aliasing

	- Sokol Compute Shaders
		- [DONE] updated sokol to latest version
		- [TODO] first use-case

	- make sure children are handled in post depsgraph update (deletion)
	- Clean up dynamic gameplay component system. Make sure all the per-type stuff stays together
		- maybe an init class method?

Bugs:
	- last 'mesh' object can't be deleted for some reason
	- delete-all doesn't work either, likely related to above
	- object deletion or undo/redo sends full update?
