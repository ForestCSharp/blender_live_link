- V1: live update just replaces object-data wholesale (make sure to clean up old data)
- TODO: keep data layout the same as blender, hopefully avoid a big 'ol python loop and just memcpy vertex data
- TODO: handle object deletion (track objects in depsgraph callback?)


- TODO: object deletion or undo/redo sends full update?
