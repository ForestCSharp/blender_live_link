TODO
	- Materials + Textures
		- TODO: Need to use some default material if no material assigned in blender

		- V1: Just send base_color, metallic, roughness as values
		- V2: Optional textures for those three as well
			- textures will need a similar setup to key by their uid and stored at top-level Update table
	- Fix IsGrounded for Character Jumping

Tasks:
	- Skinned Animations
	- Texturing and PBR
		- subset of blender nodes converted to material shaders...
	- Reflection Captures
	- Shadows
		- Cascaded Shadow Map on Sunlight
		- Screen Space Shadows
	- Temporal Anti Aliasing

	- Sokol Compute Shaders
		- [TODO] first use-case

Improvements:
	- On Updates, don't re-create all object functionality, determine what actually changed and just update that
		- ex: If you didn't change geometry, don't recreate mesh
		- ex: If you didn't change physics, don't recreate physics state
	- Consider option to wait until a move operation is done to send a live link update
	- Make sure rigid body and character don't exist on same object
	- replace optional ids for character and camera control with map of tagged IDs
	- 

Bugs:
	- deleting a child by deleting its parent in blender doesn't delete the child in game
	- deleting object representing our player character or camera control is currently invalid
		- need to clean up the id's representing those entities
